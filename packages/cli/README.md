## How to install

```
npm i -g @graphql-reshape/cli
```

## How to use

Installing will give you the command `reshape` which will give you an interactive menu to apply transformations to your `.graphql` files.

If you want to programatically use the cli actions (maybe as part of your own script) you can import them directly from their specific directory found in `@graphql-reshape/cli/lib/actions`
